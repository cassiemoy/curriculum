<a id="prework">0.1: Prework</a>
---------------------

+ Verify you computer has a modern web browser. We *highly* recommend using the latest version of Chrome or Firefox
+ **Do:** Install a text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
+ **Do:** Decide on a note-taking/journaling format. You are going to be learning a lot of information, and you will need a place to store it. You can use a physical notebook, a Google doc, Evernote. Do what works for you, but make sure you have a place to store your notes, questions, and reflections

<a id="whyprogramming">0.2: Why Programming?</a>
-----------------------

+ Read: [Why Programming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1osMSZukhRBLEUU-rR_vCQFQza8JTRK3JKxsPT59RQY4/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Key Takeaway:** While not everyone wants to be or should be a professional software engineer, a basic understanding of computing concepts and how web/mobile applications work is critical for success in a networked world.

<a id="webapps">0.3: How do web apps work?</a>
-----------------------------

+ Read: [How web apps work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19RxelsKDMjY2Oi8DCIx48coeAL37c2mNay3QbMMW8pA/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Key Takeaway:** A web application is software that runs in a browser. The “front-end” of the application is the part the user interacts with in the browser and written using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

<a id="build">0.4: What will you build?</a>
-----------------------------

+ Read: [What will you build?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ciV5iUNyFe1EYvASq3VSm9PnKCe01EPnQIceTqgcoTo/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Exercise:** [What will you build?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14X7nE7GHL5JJFpuuB8hdJSwOgZzAPKcumTnWisu9uEk/edit?usp=sharing)
+ **Key Takeaway:** There are numerous web programming languages, and deciding which one to learn is complicated. However, HTML, CSS and Javascript are the foundation of most websites and are beneficial for every programmer, regardless of her specialty. 

<a id="texteditors">0.5: Tools of the Trade: Text Editors</a>
---------------------------------------

+ **Do:** Install a text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
+ **Key Takeaway:** The entirety of the internet is basically text files held in convenient locations and written in languages that computers understand. Text editors allow us to write/edit these files!

<a id="eval">0.6: Evaluation</a>
---------------------------------------

+ **Exercise:** Complete [this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ieaYd4ceiemiNazmClOWiHVlnyt3WqTPZLPFeD23QRE/viewform) and tell us what you thought of this unit, and how it can be improved.
